I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in computer and information sciences at Northumbria University, Newcastle. In addition to my computer science background, I have an interest in the fields of psychology and sociology. I draw from these disciplines in my research which is centred around understanding and improving various online social interactions and computer and AI-mediated communication behaviours. I have successfully collaborated with researchers across the world and published and presented at two top HCI/CSCW conferences. Using exploratory, qualitative methods I am able to immerse myself into a subject-area and develop a rich, theory-driven understanding of a given environment and the behaviours of users. In doing so, I am able to identify problems that are having a real impact on people’s lives. I am then able to use quantitative methods to understand how generalised these problems are, and the role of design in addressing these problems.

### PhD Research

During my PhD at the Institute of Digital Health within UCL’s Interaction Centre (UCLIC), I used mixed methods, drawing on theory from the fields of psychology, economics, sociology, and evolutionary biology, to understand people’s online social behaviours. I was especially interested in how people manage privacy around sensitive information in online social spaces.

My PhD research which was published at leading HCI conferences (CSCW, CHI) was interested in how men who have sex with men (MSM) manage HIV status information in online sex-social apps (dating apps). I’ve utilised secondary sources of public domain data to understand user attitudes to HIV status disclosure fields being introduced into these environments. Having conducted extensive interviews with users, I have developed behavioural insights into why users choose to disclose their status through these HIV status disclosure fields, and how these fields are affecting user interactions. My work challenges the notion of control in the design of sensitive disclosure fields and suggests that privacy may unravel around non-disclosures, as those not disclosing may be assumed to be “hiding” undesirable information.

My PhD research was funded by <a href="https://www.privacyus.eu">Privacy&Us</a>, an EU Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks.

### Current Research

I am broadly interested in HCI/social computing research relating to online communication. I have primarily focused on research around online social media and communication technologies. However, I am also interested in research at the intersection of technology and crime and policing. I am currently Co-I on a large UKRI funded (£400,000) Observatory for Monitorng Data-Driven Approaches to COVID-19 (OMDDAC).
